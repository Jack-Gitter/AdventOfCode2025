1) loop over a row once, find the highest number that is NOT the last digit. In the event of ties, record the earliest index. Always record the index

2) loop over again starting at the earliest index+1, find the highest number. That is our answer!

for part 2 ------------

1) keep taking every item
2) if the new item is greater than the previous item, replace it. keep replacing
while the new item is higher than the previous item.
3) if we reach a point where (12 - current len) = len of remaining items, then just take all remaining items
